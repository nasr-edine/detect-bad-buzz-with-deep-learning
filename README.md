# Project: Detect Bad Buzz with Deep Learning

This README provides a concise summary of the project "Detect Bad Buzz with Deep Learning" offered in the "Ing√©nieur IA" training at OpenClassrooms.

## Context

This project is designed for students to apply the following skills:

- Training a Deep Learning model on text data.
- Implementing an MLOps-oriented approach.

## Objectives

The main objective is to create an AI prototype capable of anticipating negative publicity on social media by predicting sentiment in tweets (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Project Outline

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

- Data is collected from an open-source dataset.
- Data preprocessing includes removing irrelevant elements (e.g., hashtags, links).

### 2. Model Development

Two approaches are tested:

- "Custom Model Simple": Using classic models like logistic regression.
- "Custom Model Advanced": Leveraging deep learning models for sentiment prediction.

### 3. Model Evaluation

Models are assessed for performance on a test dataset.

### 4. Model Deployment

The best-performing model is deployed on a cloud service with an accessible API.

## Deliverables

- Deployed advanced custom model on a cloud service.
- Scripts for model training and usage.
- A blog post (1000-1200 words) covering:
  - Presentation and comparison of the three approaches.
  - Details of the implemented MLOps-oriented approach.
- A presentation slide deck summarizing the methodological approach, model results, and deployment process.
- Screenshots of commits, the GitHub repository, and unit test execution to demonstrate continuous deployment.
